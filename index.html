            <h3 id="css">What is CSS?</h3>
            <p>Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simple design language intended to
                simplify the process of making web pages presentable.
                CSS handles the look and feel part of a web page. Using CSS, you can control the color of the
                text, the style of fonts, the spacing between paragraphs, how columns are sized and laid out,
                what background images or colors are used, as well as a variety of other effects.
                CSS is easy to learn and understand but it provides a powerful control over the presentation
                of an HTML document. Most commonly, CSS is combined with the markup languages HTML
                or XHTML.</p>
            <h3 id="advantages of css">Advantages of CSS</h3>
            <ul>
                <li> CSS saves time - You can write CSS once and then reuse the same sheet in multiple
                    HTML pages. You can define a style for each HTML element and apply it to as many
                    web pages as you want.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Pages load faster - If you are using CSS, you do not need to write HTML tag
                    attributes every time. Just write one CSS rule of a tag and apply it to all the
                    occurrences of that tag. So, less code means faster download times.
                </li>
                <li>Easy maintenance - To make a global change, simply change the style, and all the
                    elements in all the web pages will be updated automatically.</li>
                <li>Multiple Device Compatibility - Style sheets allow content to be optimized for more
                    than one type of device. By using the same HTML document, different versions of a
                    website can be presented for handheld devices such as PDAs and cellphones or for
                    printing.</li>
                <li>Superior styles to HTML - CSS has a much wider array of attributes than HTML, so
                    you can give a far better look to your HTML page in comparison to HTML attributes</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="who creates and maintains css?">Who Creates and Maintains CSS?</h3>
            <p>CSS is created and maintained through a group of people within the W3C called the CSS
                Working Group. The CSS Working Group creates documents called specifications. When a
                specification has been discussed and officially ratified by the W3C members, it becomes a
                recommendation. </p>
            <h3 id="css versions">CSS Versions</h3>
            <p>Cascading Style Sheets level 1 (CSS1) came out of W3C as a recommendation in December
                1996. This version describes the CSS language as well as a simple visual formatting model
                for all the HTML tags.
                CSS2 became a W3C recommendation in May 1998 and builds on CSS1. This version adds
                support for media-specific style sheets e.g. printers and aural devices, downloadable fonts,
                element positioning and tables.</p>
            <h3 id="the descendant selectors">The Descendant Selectors</h3>
            <p>Suppose you want to apply a style rule to a particular element only when it lies inside a
                particular element. As given in the following example, the style rule will apply to <em></p>
            <h3 id="the class selectors">The Class Selectors</h3>
            <p>You can define style rules based on the class attribute of the elements. All the elements having
                that class will be formatted according to the defined rule.</p>
            <h3 id="the id selectors">The ID Selectors</h3>
            <p>You can define style rules based on the id attribute of the elements. All the elements having
                that id will be formatted according to the defined rule.</p>
            <h3 id="the child selectors">The Child Selectors</h3>
            <p>You have seen the descendant selectors. There is one more type of selector, which is very
                similar to descendants but have different functionality. Consider the following example:</p>
            <h3 id="grouping selectors">Grouping Selectors</h3>
            <p>You can apply a style to many selectors if you like. Just separate the selectors with a comma,
                as given in the following example:
            </p>
            <h3 id="css rules overriding">CSS Rules Overriding</h3>
            <p>We have discussed four ways to include style sheet rules in an HTML document. Here is the
                rule to override any Style Sheet Rule.
